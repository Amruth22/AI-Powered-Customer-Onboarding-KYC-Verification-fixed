# Problem Statement

## AI-Powered Customer Onboarding KYC Verification System with CrewAI Document Processing

### Background

Financial institutions and regulated businesses face significant challenges in customer onboarding and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance processes. Traditional KYC verification involves manual document review, data extraction, and compliance checking, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. With increasing regulatory requirements and the need for faster customer onboarding, organizations require automated solutions that can intelligently process various document types, extract critical information, and ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulatory standards.

### Problem Statement

Financial institutions and compliance teams dealing with customer onboarding often struggle with:
- **Manual Document Processing**: Time-consuming manual review of identity documents, financial statements, and compliance forms
- **Inconsistent Data Extraction**: Human error in extracting critical information from various document formats
- **Compliance Verification Delays**: Slow verification of customer information against regulatory requirements
- **Document Format Complexity**: Difficulty processing multiple document types (PDFs, images, text files) consistently
- **Risk Assessment Inefficiency**: Manual risk profiling and PEP (Politically Exposed Person) screening processes
- **Regulatory Compliance Burden**: Ensuring adherence to AML, KYC, and other financial regulations
- **Customer Experience Impact**: Slow onboarding processes leading to customer frustration and abandonment
- **Audit Trail Requirements**: Need for comprehensive documentation and audit trails for regulatory compliance

This leads to extended customer onboarding times, increased operational costs, compliance risks, and poor customer experience.

## Objective

Design and implement a **fully automated, AI-powered KYC verification system** that:

1. **Processes Multiple Document Types** including PDFs, text files, images, and office documents
2. **Extracts Comprehensive Metadata** with advanced file analysis and content extraction
3. **Performs Intelligent Content Analysis** using CrewAI agents and Gemini AI for document understanding
4. **Identifies KYC-Specific Information** including personal data, identification documents, and risk factors
5. **Generates Structured Output** with JSON-formatted analysis results for downstream systems
6. **Ensures Compliance Verification** with automated checks for regulatory requirements
7. **Provides Command-Line Interface** for easy integration into existing workflows
8. **Maintains Audit Trails** with comprehensive logging and documentation for regulatory compliance
